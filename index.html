<h2 is-upgraded>Securing Your Spot After Freshmore</h2>
<p>In order of priority, here are some things that you need to know as housing goes by this for consideration to allocate you for housing.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Do not get yourself a letter of warning and a notice of breach. Follow the rules spelt out. </li>
<li>Attend more than 2 events for each term. You get free participation points and mostly free food.</li>
<li>For local students, if you stay in the middle of Singapore or further, your chances are higher for a longer-term stay.</li>
<li>This is very important: Applying for housing before the closing date in your emails at every application cycle. </li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Getting Around Campus" duration="0">
        <p>After some time in school, you would realise that rooms in our school are often referred to using code numbers (e.g. 2.506). Here&#39;s a quick breakdown of what this code means to ease getting yourself around:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(#</strong>.___) The number at the left of the decimal represents the building where the room may be found.</li>
<li>Building 1 is where the library may be found</li>
<li>Building 2 is where the campus center may be found</li>
<li>Building 3 is opposite the campus center, where you will find the One Stop Centre</li>
<li>Building 5 is where the FabLab may be found</li>
<li>(_.<strong>###) </strong>For the number at the right of the decimal, the first digit represents the floor where the building may be found, and the other two numbers represent the room number.</li>
<li><strong>TL;DR: The format of the room code is [Building].[Floor][Room] so for example 2.504 references a room in Building 2, Level 5, Room 4.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if you need to go across buildings, the following levels are interconnected in this fashion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 2: The second floor of the Campus Centre links Buildings 2 and 3.</li>
<li>Level 3: The roof area above the Campus Centre links Buildings 1,2, and 3. An additional link bridge links Buildings 1 and 2 in the middle of Building 1. A final link bridge is hidden along Building 1, which links Buildings 1 and 5.</li>
<li>Level 5: The link bridge roof is walkable and links Buildings 1 and 2.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Getting the Most out of SUTD" duration="5">
        <p>Time is short in SUTD, and 8 terms can pass by you in a flash. Here are some suggestions to help you get the most out of your time here in SUTD.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know what you want to get out of SUTD.</strong> Be it a career path, a good social circle, or technical skills. This will help inform the choices you make and help you prioritise what matters to you.</li>
<li><strong>Appreciate the value of time. </strong>Your time is finite, and every choice has an opportunity cost to yourself and others. Make your choice clear to both.</li>
<li><strong>Be reasonable to the people giving you the opportunity and be clear about your level of commitment.</strong> There are too many opportunities in SUTD, and most of them might be tempting. It is alright to explore, but be responsible!</li>
<li><strong>When it comes to commitments, aim for quality over quantity.</strong> You will be unable to gain much if you take on too many things. It is recommended to be part of a maximum of up to 2 fifth rows and 1 active UROP only.</li>
<li><strong>Finish what you start!</strong> Being responsible establishes you as a reliable team member which helps with finding and building teams. You not only build up a portfolio of completed projects, but also secure internships.</li>
<li><strong>Be mindful of how you conduct yourself.</strong> SUTD is small, and news spreads quickly. It is very easy to be famous or infamous for the way you carry yourself, and how you treat your commitments.</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Acquiring Technical Skills" duration="5">
        <p>The SUTD curriculum provides you with robust theoretical foundations and bare minimum practical foundations, which might not be sufficient for thriving in the working world. And in fact, many of the more &#34;applied&#34; courses occur late in your undergrad career (Term 6 onwards). This is <strong>after</strong> your internship opportunities and about the time when you begin your job hunt.</p>
<p><strong>In our experience, projects and technical skills can weigh far more heavily than grades can. It is important to avoid focusing solely on grades, as it is very important to bolster your knowledge with practical and technical skills for the career path you at looking for.</strong></p>
<p>As such you should be prepared to develop your skills during your own time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilise extra-curricular opportunities, such as technical Fifth Rows</li>
<li>Self-learn from freely available resources on the Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend spending Term 1 joining a UROP, or specialist clubs and societies to try to bolster your skills! Take advantage of the lower academic pressure to invest in your technical abilities. Remember, no matter how well or badly you do, every grade is still recorded as &#39;PASS&#39; in Term 1.</p>
<p>Then, with a foundation, to start diving into a deeper project or discipline in Term 2 immediately. Pillar years can get quite hectic, and many students find they no longer have the time to spend self-learning technical skills then. Your Freshmore year is the best time to get a firm technical foundation!</p>
<p>That said, don&#39;t go around failing subjects! Grades are still relevant. They help you to open up a lot of opportunities in school (like exchanges) and are important for pursuing further studies as well as qualifying for careers in certain sectors (particularly Government sectors and Academia).</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Doors are always Open</h2>
<p>In SUTD, the faculty and staff are always willing to engage with students. Email professors directly if you&#39;re interested in their work, or if you have an interesting idea, and need some help.</p>
<p>Outside of school, you&#39;ll often realise that people are pretty welcoming as well. Don&#39;t be afraid to cold call companies for opportunities such as internships or mentorship. It is common for students to get better responses from contacting the company directly compared to using the official career portal.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Research Opportunities" duration="5">
        <p>At SUTD, plenty of opportunities for people of different interests are available, and those with a keen desire to do research work will find that plenty of research opportunities abound. During the first few weeks in school, we would like to nudge you to think about topics you are interested in, do a bit of your research/reading, and figure out if you would like to pursue it as a UROP!</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP)</strong></h2>
<p>Funding: Up to $1500 per project</p>
<p>UROPs are the main source of research opportunities for undergraduate students. There are 2 ways that one can join a UROP:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Applying for a project listed by a Professor/Faculty member on MyPortal. Students are to contact project supervisors to discuss the details of the project before applying<img style="width: 624.00px" src="img\\93b3bebe79550b4f.png"></li>
<li>No projects to suit your fancy? Pitch your project! At SUTD, the professors and faculty are more than willing to support/guide students in their own initiated projects. If you have an idea that you feel is worth exploring, but lack the guidance and financial support to do so, a self-initiated UROP is always a good idea.</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Managing the Workload in SUTD" duration="5">
        <p>It is not uncommon to have multiple assignments due in the same week (or day), along with multiple project checkpoints or submissions in certain weeks (often right before or after recess week). You should mentally prepare yourself for the workload.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help manage the workload:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not be complacent. Be fully prepared to put in consistent effort.</li>
<li>It is very easy to fall behind by accident, and the pace of the curriculum makes it even harder to catch up. Don&#39;t think you can &#34;catch up later&#34;.</li>
<li>Putting in work early helps you prevent late or even sleepless nights. However, things break, and this means you might need to stay up to fix things.</li>
<li>It helps to keep a to-do list on hand to help keep track of your tasks.</li>
<li>Manage your academics with your peers! Grab dinner at CCP with your friends to destress, but do it in moderation.</li>
<li>Term 1 is Pass / Fail so please go and enjoy campus / hostel life. </li>
